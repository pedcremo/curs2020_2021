# BINGO TWINGO
Bingo twingo is a web application development project in offline mode that consists of a traditional online bingo to play without an internet connection.

Expack is the bare-bones Express and Webpack boilerplate with ES6+ babel transpilation, ESLint linting, Hot Module Reloading, and Jest test framework enabled.

Expack has two build modes: Development and Production.

When you run `npm run buildDev`, Javascript, HTML, and CSS files are unminified and not uglified, meaning that you can easily inspect them in Chrome Dev Tools. Hot Module Reloading is enabled via `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware`. 

When you run `npm run buildProd`, Javascript, HTML, and CSS files are all minified and uglified, and images are encoded as Base64 directly into your CSS file, which results in less calls to the server for image files.

## Google App Engine Flex Deployment

Expack can be deployed directly to Google App Engine Flex with the command `npm run deploy`. **IMPORTANT:** Currently `app.yaml` is configured to use minimal resources to save on cost, which is great for development but terrible for production. Please review and update `app.yaml` to suit your own needs.

## Get starting ðŸš€
To be able to put the web application into operation you need to have these tools installed.

### Node.js
If your operating system is windows you can go to the official [node.js][nodejs] page and you can download the executable, if your operating system is linux perform the following steps.

Requires Node.js v4+ to run.
```sh
$ sudo apt install nodejs
```

To check if nodejs and the npm package installer has been installed correctly we can use:
```sh
$ node --version
Output
v10.19.0

$ npm --version
Output
6.4.1
```

### For development environmentsâ€¦

We install all the packages that the application needs for its deployment.
``` sh
$ npm install
```
When all the packages have finally been installed we will create the execution files with [weback][webpack]:
``` sh
$ npm run buildDev
```
And finally to run the project through port 8080:
``` sh
$ npm start
```
### For testing
``` sh
$ npm test
$ npm run coverage        // generates a coverage report
```

## Troubleshooting

Node.js: what is ENOSPC error and how to solve?
``` sh
$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

Upgrade node to the latest stable
``` sh
$ sudo npm install -g n
$ sudo n stable
```
